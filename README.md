gone-lib
========

Golang one liners library.

The purpose of this library is to remove the need to create (essentially) temporary types for common actions. Therefore this library leans towards achieving ease-of-use rather than program efficiency.

The following packages currently exist:

* Email package that allows quick sending of HTML or plain emails. See [examples](http://godoc.org/github.com/paulchiu/gone-lib/email#_example_Send) for how to send emails in Golang using services such as Gmail.
* CSV package that allows for reading of all CSV data from a filename. See [example](http://godoc.org/github.com/paulchiu/gone-lib/csv/#example_ReadAll).
